// An alert is a box that pops up to give the user a message. Here's code for an alert that
// displays the message "Thanks for your input!

alert("Thanks for your Input");
// alert is a keyword

// Some coders write window.alert instead of, simply, alert. This is a highly formal but
// perfectly correct way to write it. Most coders prefer the short form. We'll stick to the
// short form in this training.

window.alert("Thanks for your Input");
