// A variable name can't contain any spaces.
// A variable name can contain only letters, numbers, dollar signs, and underscores.
// Though a variable name can't be any of JavaScript's keywords, it can contain keywords.
// For example, userAlert and myVar are legal.
// Capital letters are fine, but be careful. Variable names are case sensitive
// For example ,  A rose is not a Rose
// Please adopt the
// camelCase convention. It'll make your variable names more readable, and you'll be less
// likely to get variable names mixed up
// Examples:
var userName = "Sohail Shoukat";
var userAge = 22;

// Note userName & userAge is camelCase
