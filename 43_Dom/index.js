// The DOM (Document Object Model)  is a programming interface for web documents
//  It represents the structure of a web page as a tree of objects,
// where each object corresponds to a part of the page (like elements, attributes, and text).
//JavaScript can interact with the DOM to dynamically modify the content and structure of a webpage.

console.log("Hello World");
window.console.log("Hello ");
console.log(window);
console.log(window.document);
