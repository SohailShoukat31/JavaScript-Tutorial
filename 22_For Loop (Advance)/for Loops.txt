There are Three Basic Loops 
For Loops
While Loops
Do While Loops


For loop: You know how many times you’ll do something.
While loop: You don’t know how many times, but you stop when something is true.
Do-while loop: You always do something at least once, then decide if you want to keep going

Initialization: let cookie = 1:
This part initializes a variable called cookie and sets its value to 1.
This variable (cookie) is like a counter that will keep track of how many cookies have been baked so far.
It only runs once at the start of the loop.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Condition: cookie <= 12:
This is the condition that controls how long the loop will run.
The loop will continue to run as long as this condition is true.
In this case, it checks whether the cookie variable is less than or equal to 12. Once cookie becomes greater than 12, the loop will stop.

Update or Increment | Decrement : cookie++:
This is the increment part. Every time the loop finishes one cycle (one cookie baked), it adds 1 to the value of cookie.
cookie++ is shorthand for cookie = cookie + 1.
